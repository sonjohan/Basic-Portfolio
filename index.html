                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, I’m a designer and a very curious person who believes in research and smart
                    work in order to achieve every goal.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What I do?</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m a multimedia designer at Clover Imaging Group I have lots fun working, love everything about each day, even
                    if I frowned for a while I still find the good side of it after a while, looking for small details within
                    the big picture is a very important part my life since the quality is defined by the details.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What I want to do?</h3>             
                <p>
                    Everything, I still want to rule the world!, how? I try learning as much as possible every day, I’m
                    always curious, from how to cook a new dish to watching tutorials, one of my goals is being able to transmit
                    all of the information I've collected to someone in the future.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What do I like?</h3>
                <p>
                    I like doing a little bit of everything every day, read for while, skate, watch some tv, maybe play a game,
                    listen to music, even sing something from what I’m listening to (I’m a awful singer), I love being up
                    to date so reading news and creativity blogs are really a big part of my day.
