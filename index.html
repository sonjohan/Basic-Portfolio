                Who am I? Today, I’m a designer and a very curious person who believes in research and smart work in order to
                achieve every goal. What I do? I’m a multimedia designer at Clover Imaging Group I have lots fun working,
                love everything about each day, even if I frowned for a while I still find the good side of it after a while,
                looking for small details within the big picture is a very important part my life since the quality is defined
                by the details. What I want to do ? Everything, I still want to rule the world !, how? I try learning as
                much as possible every day, I’m always curious, from how to cook a new dish to watching tutorials, one of
                my goals is being able to transmit all of the information I've collected to someone in the future. What I
                like? I like doing a little bit of everything every day, read for while, skate, watch some tv, maybe play
                a game, listen to music, even sing something from what I’m listening to (I’m a awful singer), I love being
                up to date so reading news and creativity blogs are really a big part of my day.
